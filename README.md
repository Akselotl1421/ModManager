## How to use it?

- Launch Mod Manager from windows (use the shortcut or the search bar).

- A window will open.

- You can select any number of mods just by checking them; then, press update to install them.

- If at any point, you want to remove all mods installed, you have a button to do so.

- You are ready to play! :)

## How to synchronize your installed mods with your friends?

Below the mod manager menu, there is a code that you can share with your friends. After your friends entered the code into their Mod Manager, they will have the same configurations as you.

## Making a mod compatible with Mod Manager

Publish a release in a public GitHub repository for your mod. In this release, you can add either (or both):

- The .dll file of the mod

- A .zip with of the Among Us modded directory

Then, join the [discord](https://mm.matux.fr/discord) and send your repository link. It will be a pleasure adding your mod. :)
