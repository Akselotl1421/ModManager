The Cultists start with a single Cultist (The Cultist Leader) that can convert other crew members to the cult. They can not convert Impostors.\r\n\r\nIf there are more cultists alive than non-cultists, the Cult wins. For example, if there are 5 players alive and 3 of them are cultists, they win. Cultists don't have any tasks (and currently no fake tasks, so if you are new to among us, you should probably play some games without this mod first) and if a crewmate gets converted, their tasks are removed. The Cultists have a maximum number of conversion they can execute, when they are out of attempts they can not convert any more members.\r\n\r\nDepending on the settings, the Cultists have a lower overall vision and the Cult leader should carefully chose who he wants to convert.\r\n\r\nThis mod makes for some interesting overall gameplay changes because:\r\n- The crewmates need to make sure they not only vote out Impostors but Cultists as well, otherwise the Cult will easily win.\r\n- The Impostors need to make sure they don't kill randomly, they need to figure out who the cultist are, and make sure that they don't make the cultists win by killing a crewmate.\r\n- There is a new aspect of changing your faction during the game. For example, someone who was confirmed by a med-scan, could be a Cultist later on!"}
